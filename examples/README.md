## CondEvo Examples
This directory contains examples from our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13420), and for reinforcement learning tasks using the `gym` environment, see the [gymlibrary](https://www.gymlibrary.dev).

### Conditional Evolution Examples
See various examples from our [HADES paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13420) as jupyter notebooks in the [examples/conditional](conditional) directory.

### Gym Reinforcement Learning Examples
See reinforcement learning examples in the [examples/gym](gym) directory.

### Custom Evolutionary Tasks
See the [examples/evolution](evolution) directory for custom evolutionary tasks.

For instance in [examples/evolution/nd_targets.py](evolution/nd_targets.py), we search for multiple solution points in an N-dimensional space using different variants of the HADES algorithm.
